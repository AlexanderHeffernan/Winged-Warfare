# Project description
For CGRA 151, I worked on a project involving the creation of a game using Processing. The game was a 2D endless experience set during World War II. Players took on the role of a Spitfire pilot flying over battlefields, engaging in aerial combat to shoot down enemy planes. The game also involved bombing enemy tanks and encampments for a comprehensive and thrilling gaming experience.
